# scratch-extension-creator
A Java project that allows users to add blocks to Scratch! (scratch.mit.edu)
##### This code is VERY messy, so I suggest opening it in Eclipse with Java 1.8.
####Bug reporting:
If you find a bug in the program, feel free to report it to me. I've tried my best to clean them all out, but since this program is so complex, it's just nature that
there will be some bugs. If the bug occurs when the program crashes, send me the stack trace (error text) Sometimes, errors will not crash the program but will just
print the error. The stack trace can help me find out where I messed up in the code.
